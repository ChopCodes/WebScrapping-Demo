# ChopCodes/WebScrapping-Demo
# Unfinished Project

This Python script scrapes data from the NASA Exoplanet Catalog website. It uses the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries to extract information about exoplanets.

#### Note: The code might not work like it should if you have latest version of Selenium, I am trying to fix the issue,

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the appropriate ChromeDriver executable and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

Run the script by executing `python scraper.py`. The script will open a Chrome browser window and start scraping data from the catalog. The extracted data will be stored in a CSV file named `exoplanet_data.csv`.

## Dependencies
